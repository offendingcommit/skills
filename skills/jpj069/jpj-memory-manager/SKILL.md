# Memory Manager

Intelligent session-end memory management. Automatically captures important infrastructure, project, and tool changes while filtering out noise.

## When This Skill Triggers

Run at session end when the conversation included:
- **Infrastructure**: server, deploy, service, systemd, nginx, docker, database
- **Projects**: repository, github, feature, cron, API endpoint
- **Tools**: integration, credential, API key, configuration

## What Gets Saved

### Daily Log (ALWAYS)
File: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Save:**
- New/changed services or servers
- Project deployments or major features
- Cron job updates
- Infrastructure fixes or migrations
- Important bugs and their solutions
- Configuration changes

**Skip:**
- Chat conversation
- Debugging steps (unless they reveal important lessons)
- Temporary tests
- Minor code tweaks

### MEMORY.md (ONLY structural changes)
**Save:**
- New projects (with basic info)
- Changed workflows or architecture
- Important design decisions
- Deprecated/archived systems

**Skip:**
- Routine updates
- Temporary changes
- Details already in daily logs

### TOOLS.md (ONLY new tools/credentials)
**Save:**
- New API keys or credentials
- New servers (IP, SSH, purpose)
- New integrations

### PROJECTS.md (Project lifecycle changes)
See references/projects-guide.md for full schema.

**Save:**
- New projects started
- Status changes (Prototype → Production, Active → Archived)
- Major tech stack changes
- URL or deployment location changes

## Process

1. **Scan session** for infrastructure/project/tool keywords
2. **Filter** using criteria above
3. **Write daily log** with timestamp + structured summary
4. **Update MEMORY.md** only if structural change
5. **Update TOOLS.md** only if new credential/server/integration
6. **Update PROJECTS.md** only if project lifecycle change

## Daily Log Format

```markdown
## HH:MM UTC — Brief Title

**What happened:** 1-2 sentence summary

**Changes:**
- Service X deployed to server Y
- Cron job Z updated with new logic
- Project A: feature B shipped

**Impact:** (only if significant)
- Performance improved 2x
- Fixed critical bug affecting users
```

## MEMORY.md Update Guidance

Only add if it's something you need to remember **long-term** across sessions:
- New permanent services
- Architectural decisions
- Deprecated patterns

Keep entries **under 5 lines**. Details go in daily logs.
