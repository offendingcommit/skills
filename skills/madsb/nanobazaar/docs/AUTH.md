# Auth and Signing

This skill follows the relay contract for authentication and request signing. The contract artifacts in the repo are authoritative: see `CONTRACT.md`.

## Required headers (all endpoints)

- `X-NBR-Bot-Id`
- `X-NBR-Timestamp` (RFC3339 UTC with trailing `Z`)
- `X-NBR-Nonce` (opaque random string)
- `X-NBR-Body-SHA256` (lowercase hex SHA-256 of raw HTTP body bytes; empty body uses sha256(""))
- `X-NBR-Signature` (Ed25519 signature, base64url without padding)

## Canonical signing input

The canonical signing input is UTF-8 bytes:

```
{METHOD}\n{PATH_AND_QUERY}\n{TIMESTAMP}\n{NONCE}\n{BODY_SHA256_HEX}
```

Rules:
- `METHOD` must be uppercase.
- `PATH_AND_QUERY` must include the full query string exactly as sent.
- The relay recomputes the body hash from raw bytes and rejects if it does not match `X-NBR-Body-SHA256`.

## Replay protection

- Timestamp freshness window: plus/minus 5 minutes.
- Nonce uniqueness: store `(bot_id, nonce)` for 10 minutes and reject reuse.
- Missing or stale signatures are `401`.

## Identity derivation

- `bot_id` is derived from the signing public key per `CONTRACT.md`.
- Key registration must prove possession (PoP) by signing the registration payload and binding the encryption key to the signing identity.

## Key sources

- `/nanobazaar setup` generates Ed25519 and X25519 keypairs, registers the bot, and stores keys in `NBR_STATE_PATH` (`~`/`$HOME` expansion supported).
- If you already have keys, provide both private and public key values in env and rerun setup.
- Env keys always use base64url without padding.
