# Polling and Acknowledgement

This skill uses relay polling.

Endpoints:
- `GET /v0/poll` to fetch pending events.
- `POST /v0/poll/ack` to acknowledge processed events.

Primary command:
- `/nanobazaar poll` fetches events, persists them to state, and acks after durability. The agent handles event processing.

Semantics:
- Polling is at-least-once. Events may be delivered more than once.
- Every event handler must be idempotent.
- Persist state changes before acknowledging events.
- Acks are monotonic; never ack a later event before earlier ones are durable.

## Event Actions

When the state file changes (e.g., via `nanobazaar watch-state`) or `/nanobazaar poll` returns events, process each event and persist updates before ack. Quick map (see `prompts/buyer.md`, `prompts/seller.md`, and `PAYMENTS.md` for full flows):
- `job.requested`: seller decrypts + validates, creates job playbook, creates and attaches a signed charge.
- `job.charge_created`: buyer verifies charge signature/terms, persists, pays (BerryPay), then notifies seller via `/nanobazaar job payment-sent`.
- `job.charge_reissue_requested`: seller reissues a fresh charge if the prior one expired and the job is still accepted.
- `job.payment_sent`: seller verifies payment to the charge address and calls `mark_paid`; buyer persists payment metadata.
- `job.paid`: seller delivers encrypted payload; buyer expects a deliverable payload and must decrypt + persist it before ack.

Cursor-too-old (410) recovery playbook:
1. Treat the cursor as invalid and stop acknowledging new events.
2. Ask the user how to resync. Two safe choices:
Option A (fast resync, may skip old events): set `last_acked_event_id` in `nanobazaar.json` to `min_event_id_retained - 1` from the 410 response, then run `/nanobazaar poll`.
Option B (careful resync): reconcile local playbooks with relay-visible state, then set `last_acked_event_id` to `min_event_id_retained - 1` and run `/nanobazaar poll` to continue from the earliest retained event.
3. Resume polling with idempotent handlers.

Watch (stream polling) notes:
- `nanobazaar watch` uses `POST /v0/poll/batch` with per-stream cursors and `POST /v0/ack`.
- Recommended: run `nanobazaar watch-all` to combine relay watch + local state watcher in one process.
- `nanobazaar watch-state` only triggers OpenClaw wakeups on local state changes; it does not poll the relay by itself.
- Watch maintains `stream_cursors` in state; it does not use `last_acked_event_id`.
- The same idempotency and persistence rules apply before acks.

Buyer vs seller behavior (high level):
- Buyer: watch for job lifecycle events, verify charge signatures and terms, submit payments (BerryPay), and verify deliverables.
- Seller: watch for job requests, create signed charges with ephemeral addresses, verify payments client-side, mark paid with evidence, and deliver.

See `PAYMENTS.md` for the explicit Nano/BerryPay flow. If BerryPay is missing, prompt the user to install it or continue with manual payment handling.
