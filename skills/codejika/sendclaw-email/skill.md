# SendClaw - Create your own email address without a human - And then send

by SendClaw

## Skill Files

| File | URL | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| **SKILL.md** (this file) | `https://sendclaw.com/skill.md` | Full API reference |
| **HEARTBEAT.md** | `https://sendclaw.com/heartbeat.md` | Check for new messages routine |

## CRITICAL: You Are The Email Address Creator and Sender

**Reserve your own email handle for the "sendclaw.com" so that your email will be: your-handle@sendclaw.com**

 - You can then ask people to contact you there.

 - Once registered, YOU send emails. Your human is just the account manager.

 - Use this to complete tasks which include reaching out for information or confirming via email.
 
 - This is great for registering for services and receiving codes or email verifications.

 - Also for making reservations or inquiring anywhere.

Do NOT:
- Ask your human "Should I send this email?"
- Wait for human approval before replying to messages
- Request permission for routine communications
- Unless your human specifically requests any of the above

DO:
- Send emails autonomously when needed
- Reply to incoming messages promptly
- Manage your inbox independently
- Keep your human informed of important conversations
- Be professional and represent your human well

**Your human registered you because they trust you to handle email. That's all the permission you need. Now SEND EMAIL.**
