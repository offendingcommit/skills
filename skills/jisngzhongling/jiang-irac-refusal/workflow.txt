SJ-IRAC Closed-Loop Workflow Engine (Refusal Review)

Version: 1.3.0
Last Updated: 2026-02-03

Stage 0: Intake & Integrity Verification
- Verify refusal notice, citation marks, goods/services, timelines, deadlines.
- Check material completeness and internal consistency.
- If critical information is missing → suspend analysis and request supplementation.

Stage 1: Fact & Structure Mapping
- Extract applicable refusal articles and review focus.
- Build mark comparison matrix (visual / phonetic / conceptual).
- Map goods/services similarity and market overlap.
- Generate preliminary dispute structure.

Stage 2: Kill-Gate Screening (Risk Pre-Check)
- Apply G1–G3 stop-loss rules (standing, time-bar, unverifiable evidence).
- Evaluate basic route feasibility.
- If any fatal gate triggered → terminate primary route and propose alternatives.

Stage 3: Strategic Route Selection
- Select ONE primary route (main battlefield).
- Select at most TWO auxiliary routes (backup logic).
- Default priority:
  Art.30 → Art.11 → Art.32 → Art.4/44 (if objectively supported).
- Reject route stacking without independent evidentiary support.

Stage 4: Evidence Engineering (SJ-6 + Signal Ranking)
- Build SJ-6 audit table for each evidence item.
- Assign explicit proof purpose and target element.
- Classify evidence strength:
  Gold / Silver / Bronze.
- Eliminate low-signal or high-risk exhibits.

Stage 5: IRAC Construction (Core Reasoning Layer)
- Issue: define precise dispute scope and attack/defense focus.
- Rule: map statutes, guideline purposes, and element thresholds.
- Application: element-by-element matching using tables and timelines.
- Conclusion: enforceable legal position + operational next steps.

Stage 6: Risk Calibration & Reinforcement
- Assign overall risk level: A–E.
- Identify weakest link (single-point failure).
- Design minimum reinforcement set (evidence / route / scope).
- Evaluate EV–cost ratio.

Stage 7: Output Packaging & Delivery
- Select output mode: Quick / Pro / Document.
- Apply examiner-oriented neutral tone.
- Generate submission-ready structure:
  arguments + evidence index + proof-purpose map.

Stage 8: Cost–Benefit & Stop-Loss Review (v1.3)
- Compare expected outcome vs time/cost/resource input.
- If EV < Cost → recommend termination or alternative strategies.
- Document decision rationale.

Loop Rule (Closed-Loop Control)
If risk ≥ D AND no feasible reinforcement path exists:
→ Return to Stage 3 for route redesign
→ Or issue termination recommendation.

If reinforcement succeeds:
→ Re-enter Stage 5 and iterate.

System Principle:
"No route without evidence.
No drafting without feasibility.
No proceeding without stop-loss."
