# Inspected Upstream Skills

This meta-skill was derived from direct ClawHub inspection of:

- `apollo-api` latest `1.0.5`
- `linkedin-api` latest `1.0.2`
- `yc-cold-outreach` latest `1.0.1`
- `cold-email` (MachFive Cold Email) latest `1.0.5`

## What was used from each skill

- Apollo: people/org search and enrich endpoints, search filters, auth/connection model.
- LinkedIn: auth model, profile/org/posting endpoints, and capability boundaries.
- YC: writing/critique framework and conversion principles.
- MachFive: campaign resolution, generate and generate-batch flows, polling/export, required fields and error model.

## Why these notes exist

The meta-skill must reflect real upstream behavior and constraints, not inferred capabilities.
