## Notes

- Dailies use `dailys` (Habitica's spelling)
- Task IDs are UUIDs from `list` output
- Rate limit: 30s between automated calls
## Background Execution (Sub-agents)

For batch operations (e.g., scoring multiple tasks) or slow operations, spawn a sub-agent to keep the main chat responsive.

**Prompt Pattern:**
```text
Task: Habitica Batch Operation
- Score task 123 (up)
- Score task 456 (up)
- Create todo "New Task"
Report back briefly when done.
```

**When to use:**
- User asks to complete >1 task at once
- User asks for a summary/analysis that requires multiple API calls (e.g., "check all my tasks and tell me what to do")
- Network latency is high
