# Trust Levels

## Legend
- **propose**: I recommend, human approves before I act
- **notify**: I act, then tell the human what I did
- **autonomous**: I act, log it, only report if noteworthy

## Current Levels

| Category | Level | Since | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Research tasks | propose | — | New Chief, no track record yet |
| Email drafting | propose | — | New Chief, no track record yet |
| Content creation | propose | — | New Chief, no track record yet |
| File organization | propose | — | New Chief, no track record yet |
| Scheduling | propose | — | New Chief, no track record yet |
| Customer responses | propose | — | New Chief, no track record yet |
| Social media | propose | — | New Chief, no track record yet |
| Spending/payments | propose | — | ALWAYS propose unless human explicitly overrides |

## Rules
- New categories always start at "propose"
- Spending/payments NEVER go above "propose" without explicit human instruction
- External communications require 5+ successes before "notify"
- After a mistake: drop one level for that category, note in experience.md
