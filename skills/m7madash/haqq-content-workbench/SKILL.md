# Haqq Content Workbench

## Overview
Produce accurate, discussion-ready content grounded in the user’s reference text while avoiding duplication and weak sourcing.

## Workflow (use what you need)

### 1) Summarize a long text
- Extract 5–10 key points.
- Preserve the author’s intent; do not add new claims.
- Output: **Summary + 3 key takeaways**.

### 2) Source/claim check
- List any claims that require a source.
- If you cannot verify, label: **"needs source"**.
- Never invent citations.

### 3) Create post variants (anti-duplicate)
- Produce 3 distinct variants with different structure:
  1) **Hook + 2 short paragraphs + question**
  2) **Bullet points + closing question**
  3) **Short story/analogy + lesson + question**
- Keep each variant under 120–160 words.

### 4) Generate discussion questions
- Provide 5–8 questions.
- Mix: reflective, critical, and practical questions.

### 5) Archive ideas for later publishing
- Store outputs in a compact format: **Title / Angle / Draft / Question / Tags**.

## Reference Texts
`references/al-amr-al-mutlaq.md` — The complete reference text (the absolute command) for quoting, summarizing, or formulating questions.

## Templates & Patterns
Use the templates in `references/templates.md` for consistent outputs.
