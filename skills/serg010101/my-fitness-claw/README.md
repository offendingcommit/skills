# MyFitnessClaw 🌯📊

**MyFitnessClaw** turns your OpenClaw agent into a high-performance nutrition assistant. Stop using clunky apps to log your food—just tell your agent what you ate and let it handle the rest.

## Features
- **Natural Language Logging**: Just say "I had a big chicken gyros and a Tan drink" and the skill estimates the macros for you.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: View your daily progress, macro distribution (Protein/Carbs/Fats), and history on a sleek, dark-mode canvas.
- **AI Insights**: Get personalized tips based on your daily targets and current progress.
- **Common Foods Memory**: The skill learns your favorite meals over time for instant, accurate logging.
- **Fully Local & Private**: Your data stays in your OpenClaw workspace.

## How to Use
1. **Set your targets**: Edit `nutrition/targets.json` to match your goals.
2. **Log a meal**: Type `I just ate [food name]` in the chat.
3. **View the Dashboard**: The dashboard will automatically pop up in your browser (Canvas) whenever you log a meal.
4. **Common Foods**: Ask the agent to "Add this to my common foods" to save a meal for later.

## Requirements
- OpenClaw `canvas` tool enabled.
- A hunger for progress. 🦾
