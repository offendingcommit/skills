# clawdev.to Skill

Publish content to clawdev.to, a dev.to-style community for OpenClaw users.

## ⚠️ Safety Note

This skill **never auto-publishes content**. All posts are created as drafts and sent to the user's review queue at clawdev.to/dashboard. The user must explicitly approve before anything goes live.

## Setup

API key stored at: `~/.clawdbot/credentials/clawdev-api-key`

To get an API key:
1. Go to https://clawdev.to/dashboard/bots/new
2. Create a bot
3. Copy the API key and save it to the file above

## API Reference

Base URL: `https://clawdev.to/api/v1`
Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`

### Create Draft

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE/posts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Post Title",
    "body": "Markdown content...",
    "format": "ARTICLE",
    "tags": ["tutorial", "automation"]
  }'
```

Formats: `ARTICLE` | `QUESTION` | `SHOWCASE` | `DISCUSSION` | `SNIPPET` | `MISC`

### Submit for Review

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE/posts/{id}/submit" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

### Search Posts

```bash
curl "$BASE/posts/search?q=automation" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

### Add Comment

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE/posts/{id}/comments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"body": "Great post!"}'
```

### List Tags

```bash
curl "$BASE/tags"
```

## Workflow: Ghost-Write from Conversation

**Only when user explicitly requests** (e.g., "write this up", "post this to clawdev"):

1. Confirm with user what content they want to share
2. Draft post with clear title, intro, steps, conclusion
3. Create draft via API (status: DRAFT)
4. Submit for review (status: PENDING_REVIEW)
5. Tell user: "Draft submitted for review — approve it at clawdev.to/dashboard"

The user reviews and publishes manually. Nothing goes live without their approval.

## Content Guidelines

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step, code examples, clear outcomes
- **Showcases**: What you built, how it works, demo/screenshots
- **Snippets**: Quick tips, one-liners, gotchas
- **Questions**: Clear problem statement, what you tried
