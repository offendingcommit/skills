# Contributing to xint

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Configure required environment variables locally (see README)
3. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh) if you haven't already
4. Run `bun run xint.ts --help` to verify everything works

## Making Changes

- Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Follow the existing code style (TypeScript, no semicolons in new code is fine, match the file you're editing)
- Test your changes manually with real API calls before submitting
- Don't commit local secret/config files or generated runtime data artifacts
