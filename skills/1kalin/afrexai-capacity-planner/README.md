# Capacity Planner

Plan team and infrastructure capacity before it becomes a crisis. Maps people to projects, models scenarios, and flags bottlenecks 4-8 weeks before they hit.

**No more guessing** whether you can take on that new client or if your team is about to burn out.

## Features

- Utilization tracking with green/yellow/red bands
- Scenario modeling (new hires, attrition, scope changes)
- Buffer ratio monitoring (target 15-25%)
- Skill gap identification
- Actionable recommendations with cost impact

## Usage

Install via ClawHub, then ask your agent:

> "We have 8 engineers, 3 active projects, and a new client starting in March. Can we handle it?"

The agent audits current load, models scenarios, flags risks, and recommends specific actions — backed by numbers.
