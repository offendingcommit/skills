- **ABC-XYZ demand segmentation** — match inventory strategy to volume × variability
- **Accuracy metrics** — MAPE, bias, tracking signal with industry targets
- **Safety stock calculator** — service-level-based formula with lead time adjustment
- **Scenario planning** — bear/base/bull with probability weighting
- **Industry benchmarks** — typical MAPE and forecast horizons for 6 sectors
- **Monthly planning cycle** — 4-week cadence from statistical generation to consensus
- **Red flag checklist** — catch model drift, sandbagging, and copy-paste forecasts
