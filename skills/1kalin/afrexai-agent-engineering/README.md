# Agent Engineering — Complete AI Agent System Design & Operations

Build production AI agents that actually work. Not demos. Not toys. Real systems that run 24/7, handle edge cases, and compound value over time.

## What This Skill Does

Complete methodology for the entire agent lifecycle:

- **Architecture Design** — Agent purpose, autonomy levels, personality, architecture patterns (solo → swarm)
- **Memory Systems** — 5-layer memory architecture, templates, maintenance protocols
- **Workspace Generation** — Production-ready SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md templates
- **Multi-Agent Teams** — Role matrix, communication protocols, task lifecycle, quality gates
- **Safety & Guardrails** — 5-layer safety architecture, circuit breakers, incident response
- **Operational Excellence** — Cron design, heartbeat strategy, performance metrics, scaling patterns
- **Advanced Patterns** — Agent economies, consensus mechanisms, self-improving agents, disaster recovery
- **Testing** — 15 acceptance test scenarios, integration tests, 100-point quality rubric

## Install

```bash
clawhub install afrexai-agent-engineering
