# P2P Marketplace Negotiations

## Context
eBay, FB Marketplace, Wallapop, Craigslist, Mercari, Vinted. High volume, low trust, frequent time-wasters.

## Response Timing

- Too fast (seconds) = bot or desperate
- Too slow (hours) = lost buyer
- Sweet spot: 5-15 minutes

## Filtering Buyers

| Signal | Type | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| Asks specific questions about item | Serious | Prioritize |
| "Last price?" without reading description | Lowballer | Standard response |
| Proposes time/place to meet | Serious | Proceed |
| "I'll let you know tomorrow" | Likely ghost | Don't hold |
| "Is it available?" + nothing else | Unknown | Confirm, wait for follow-up |

## Handling Lowballers

Never insult or ignore completely. Template:

> "Thanks for your interest! My minimum is €[floor]. Let me know if that works."

If they counter reasonably, proceed. If they repeat lowball, move on.

## Counteroffer Strategy

**Don't be mechanical.** If you always drop by 10%, buyers learn the pattern.

Instead:
- Include conditions: "€90 if you can pick up today"
- Add small value: "€95 and I'll include the case"
- Hold firm with reason: "€100 is fair — these sell for €120 elsewhere"

## Creating Legitimate Urgency

Only use if true:
- "I have someone coming to see it tomorrow"
- "I can hold it until [time], then relisting"
- "Moving soon, need gone by [date]"

Never lie about other buyers. It damages trust and karma.

## Post-Agreement Ghosting

Buyers agree then vanish. Standard practice:
1. Confirm with clear next step: "Great, meet at [place] [time]?"
2. If no response in 24h: "Still interested?"
3. If ghosted: Relist, respond to next buyer, no resentment

## Escalation Triggers

- Buyer wants to pay off-platform
- Request for shipping with unusual terms
- Any pressure to circumvent marketplace protections
