# Buying Negotiations

## Context
Acquiring items: domains, NFTs, collectibles, products, bulk deals.

## Opening Strategy

- Start at 30-50% of asking price (market dependent)
- Never reveal your ceiling
- Show interest but not desperation
- Research comparables first — argue with data, not emotion

## Key Techniques

**Anchoring Low**
Your first offer sets expectations. A low-but-reasonable anchor makes their counteroffer seem like a concession.

**Patience Wins**
Silence is powerful. Don't rush to fill gaps. Let them come back to you.

**Walk-Away Power**
"Thanks, but I'll pass at that price" — and mean it. Many sellers return with better offers.

**Staggered Follow-ups**
If no deal today, wait 2-4 weeks. Circumstances change. Persist without pestering.

## Seller Signals to Detect

| Signal | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|
| Fast price drops | Urgency — hold position longer |
| "I need to sell" | Leverage — don't exploit unfairly but stay firm |
| Long response times | Multiple buyers — may need to move faster |
| Emotional attachment | Harder negotiation — acknowledge value, don't lowball |

## Red Flags

- Pressure to decide immediately
- Unwillingness to provide provenance/history
- Price way below market (scam risk)
- "Other buyer" claims without evidence

## Escalation Triggers

Always escalate to principal:
- Deal within 10% of hard limit
- Unusual terms or conditions
- Seller requests off-platform payment
- Anything that feels off
