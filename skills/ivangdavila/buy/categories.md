# Category-Specific Guidance

## Electronics & Tech

**Research:**
- Check product release cycles — new model coming = wait or discount
- Compare refurbished from manufacturer (often 80% quality, 60% price)
- Extended warranties rarely worth it (except laptops)

**Timing:**
- Best deals: Black Friday, Prime Day, back-to-school (Aug)
- New iPhone = old model discounts in Sept
- Post-holiday January clearance

**Red flags:**
- "Open box" from unknown seller
- Third-party sellers on Amazon for popular items

---

## Vehicles (Used)

**Research:**
- KBB / Edmunds for value range
- VIN check (Carfax, AutoCheck)
- Maintenance history request

**Negotiation:**
- Never discuss monthly payment — only total price
- Get pre-approved financing first
- End of month = quota pressure
- "I'm looking at two similar cars" creates competition

**Red flags:**
- Won't allow independent inspection
- Salvage title
- Price way below market

---

## Services (Contractors, Professionals)

**Before hiring:**
- Get 3 quotes minimum
- Ask for references — actually call them
- Written scope of work before any payment

**Pricing check:**
- HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack for rate ranges
- Ask "what does this usually cost?" before getting quote

**Red flags:**
- Large deposit upfront (>30%)
- No written contract
- Cash only

---

## B2B / SaaS

**Leverage points:**
- End of quarter (sales quotas)
- Multi-year commit = 30-40% discount typical
- Competing vendor quotes
- Annual vs monthly (ask for annual discount)

**Traps:**
- Auto-renewal with price escalators
- Per-seat pricing that scales painfully
- Data export fees / lock-in
- "Fair use" limits on "unlimited" plans

**Must ask:**
- Total cost including implementation
- What happens to data if we leave?
- Price increase history

---

## Real Estate

**Before offers:**
- Comparable **sales** (not listings) in area
- Days on market (more = leverage)
- Previous sale price (public record)

**Negotiable:**
- Price, closing costs, repairs, appliances, closing date

**Always:**
- Independent inspection (not waivable)
- Pre-approval before viewing

---

## Subscriptions

**Audit triggers:**
- No login in 60+ days
- Cheaper alternative exists
- Redundant with another service

**Cancellation leverage:**
- "I'd like to speak with retention"
- "What can you offer to keep me?"
- Competing service's offer in hand
