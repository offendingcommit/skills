# Negotiation Tactics

## Before Negotiating

Set your numbers:
- **Target:** What you want to pay
- **Walk-away:** Maximum you'll accept
- **Opening:** Your first offer (lower than target)

Research what others paid — this is your leverage.

## Opening Moves

**Anchor first** — State your number before they state theirs.
> "I'm looking to spend around $X"

**The flinch** — React to their price.
> "Oh, that's more than I expected." Then silence.

**Never accept first offer** — Even if good, counter once.

## Mid-Negotiation

**Broken record** — Politely repeat your position.
> "I understand, but my budget is still $X."

**Trade, don't cave** — Every concession gets something.
> "I could go to $X if you include Y."

**Higher authority** — Create an exit ramp.
> "I need to check with my partner."

## Closing

**Walk away** — Must be genuine. Actually leave.
> "Thank you, I'll think about it."

70% of the time they'll stop you with a better offer.

**Split the difference** — Use once, only at the end.
> "You're at $X, I'm at $Y, let's meet at $Z."

## Scripts by Scenario

### Retail Store
> "I saw this for $X at [competitor]. Can you match?"
> [If no] "What's the best you can do?"
> [Still no] "Is there a manager with more flexibility?"

### Used Goods (Craigslist, FB)
> "Based on recent sales, similar items went for $X. Would you take that?"
> "I can pick up today if we can agree on $X."

### Monthly Bills
> "I've been a customer for X years. I'm seeing better rates elsewhere. What can you do?"
> "I'd like to speak with your retention department."

### SaaS / B2B
> "We're evaluating competitors. What can you offer to win our business?"
> "If we commit to annual/multi-year, what discount is available?"
> "This needs to come in under $X to get budget approval."

### Car Dealership
> "I've researched this model. Fair market price is $X. I'm ready to buy today at that price."

Never discuss monthly payments. Only total out-the-door price.

## Counter-Tactics

| Their move | Your response |
|------------|---------------|
| "This is our best price" | "I understand. Let me think about it." (walk away) |
| "Limited time offer" | "If it expires, I'll find another." |
| "Someone else is interested" | "They should buy it then." |
| "I need to check with my manager" | Wait. It's a negotiation tactic. |
