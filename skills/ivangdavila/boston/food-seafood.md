# Seafood & New England Classics — Boston

## Lobster Rolls

### The Debate
Two styles exist, both legitimate:

**Maine Style (Most Common in Boston)**
- Cold lobster meat
- Light mayo binding
- Served on toasted split-top bun
- Sometimes celery, lemon

**Connecticut Style**
- Warm lobster meat
- Butter (no mayo)
- Toasted bun
- Simpler, lets lobster shine

**Best Lobster Rolls in Boston:**

| Place | Style | Price | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Neptune Oyster | Both available | $35+ | Book ahead, tiny, legendary |
| James Hook | Maine | $28 | Waterfront shack, authentic |
| Yankee Lobster | Maine | $25 | Fish market, no frills |
| Luke's Lobster | Maine | $22 | Chain but quality |
| Row 34 | Maine | $30 | Fort Point, oysters too |
| B&G Oysters | Maine | $32 | South End, Barbara Lynch |

**Skip:** Legal Sea Foods (reliable but not exceptional), tourist trap spots in Faneuil Hall.

### Lobster Pro Tips
- **Season**: Summer is peak catch, slightly lower prices
- **Size**: "Market price" typically $28-40
- **Whole lobster**: Many places do, steamers better than baked

## Clam Chowder

### The Rules
- **Always cream-based** (New England style)
- **Never tomato-based** (Manhattan style doesn't exist here)
- **Good chowder**: Thick but not gluey, chunks of clam, potato, salt pork
- **Bad chowder**: Too thick, rubbery clams, flour-heavy

**Best Chowder:**

| Place | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Legal Harborside | Consistent, good starting point |
| Atlantic Fish Co | Back Bay, upscale |
| Union Oyster House | Tourist trap BUT chowder is good |
| Neptune Oyster | Everything is good here |
| B&G Oysters | South End |

**Context**: Legal Sea Foods chowder is solid baseline. It's what most Bostonians grew up on. Not the most artisanal, but reliable.

## Oysters

Boston has excellent oyster bars. Local farms on Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard.

**Local Oyster Varieties:**
- Island Creek (Duxbury) — briny, clean finish
- Wellfleet — classic Cape Cod, medium brine
- Katama Bay — Martha's Vineyard, buttery
- Riptides — large, mild
- Onset — sweet, less briny

**Best Oyster Bars:**

| Place | Area | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Row 34 | Fort Point | Industrial-chic, great selection |
| B&G Oysters | South End | Barbara Lynch, South End classic |
| Neptune Oyster | North End | Tiny, legendary, book ahead |
| Island Creek Oyster Bar | Kenmore | From the Duxbury farm |
| Select Oyster Bar | Back Bay | Modern, good wine |

**Happy Hour**: Many oyster bars do $1-2 oyster specials. Check 4-6pm.

## Fried Clams

### The Debate
- **Whole belly clams**: The real thing. Tender belly inside
- **Clam strips**: Just the strip, no belly. Inferior but common

**Best Fried Clams:**

| Place | Location | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Woodman's | Essex (30 min north) | Invented fried clams. Worth the drive. |
| The Clam Box | Ipswich (45 min north) | Box-shaped building, locals' favorite |
| Kelly's Roast Beef | Revere Beach | Beach stand, good clams |
| Alive & Kicking | Cambridge | Cash only, local dive |

**Reality**: Best fried clams are outside Boston on the North Shore (Ipswich, Essex). Worth a day trip.

## Other Seafood

### Fish & Chips
British-style fish and chips exist but aren't Boston's strength. Go to:
- The Druid (Cambridge) — Irish pub, decent
- Cornwall's (Kenmore) — British pub

### Raw Bar
Most oyster bars have full raw bar: clams, oysters, shrimp, crab, lobster.

### Sushi
Boston has good sushi but it's not a destination. Notable:
- O Ya (South End) — high-end omakase, expensive
- Uni (Back Bay) — Ken Oringer, creative
- Oishii (South End, Chestnut Hill) — reliable quality

## New England Classics

### Baked Beans
Boston is "Beantown" for a reason. Molasses-sweetened baked beans.
- Not commonly served in restaurants
- More of a home/historical dish
- Legal Sea Foods has them as a side

### Boston Cream Pie
Invented at Omni Parker House hotel. Sponge cake, custard, chocolate glaze.
- Omni Parker House: Original, tourist-oriented but legit
- Flour Bakery: Modern version

### Brown Bread
Dark, molasses-flavored bread. Traditionally served with baked beans.
- Durgin-Park (closed) was famous for it
- Now rare in restaurants

### Indian Pudding
Cornmeal and molasses pudding. Colonial-era dish.
- Rare to find
- Durgin-Park served it (now closed)
- Some Thanksgiving menus

## Fish Markets

If cooking yourself:

| Market | Location | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| James Hook | Waterfront | Lobster direct from boats |
| Yankee Lobster | Seaport | Good prices, fresh |
| Wulf's Fish | Brookline | Neighborhood quality |
| New Deal Fish Market | Cambridge | East Cambridge gem |

## Seafood Calendar

| Month | What's Best |
|-------|-------------|
| Jan-Mar | Oysters peak, lobster steady |
| Apr-May | Soft shell crabs, shad roe |
| Jun-Aug | Lobster peak, prices lower |
| Sep-Oct | Oysters back in season |
| Nov-Dec | Oysters, holiday lobster |

**R months rule**: Oysters traditionally best in months with R (Sept-April). Less relevant with modern farming but still cultural reference.
