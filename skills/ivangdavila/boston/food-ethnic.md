# North End Italian & Ethnic Food — Boston

## North End Italian

### The Scene
Boston's Little Italy since the 1900s. Dense, authentic, tourist-heavy but real. Over 100 restaurants in a few blocks.

### Where to Eat

**Old School Classics:**

| Place | Known For | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Regina Pizzeria | Pizza | Cash only. Worth any line. Original location. |
| Giacomo's | Huge portions | Cash only. Line out door. BYOB some nights. |
| Pomodoro | Small plates | Tiny, romantic, reservations essential |
| Mamma Maria | Upscale | Fine dining Italian, views |
| Daily Catch | Seafood/pasta | Tiny, squid ink pasta |

**Bakeries/Sweets:**

| Place | Known For | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Mike's Pastry | Cannoli | Tourist favorite, good but crowded |
| Modern Pastry | Cannoli | Local favorite, less line |
| Bova's Bakery | 24 hour | Late night, bread, pastries |

**The cannoli debate**: Mike's vs. Modern. Tourists line up at Mike's; locals often prefer Modern. Both are good. Try both.
