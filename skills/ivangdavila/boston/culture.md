# Culture & Customs — Boston

## Boston Identity

### The Boston Personality
Bostonians are often described as:
- **Direct**: Say what they mean, skip small talk
- **Private**: Warm up slowly, reserved with strangers
- **Proud**: City pride runs deep
- **Intellectual**: Education is highly valued
- **Sports-obsessed**: Not optional

**Don't mistake directness for rudeness.** It's cultural efficiency.

### Regional Terms
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Wicked | Very ("wicked good") |
| Packie | Liquor store |
| Rotary | Traffic circle |
| Bubbler | Water fountain |
| Frappe | Milkshake with ice cream |
| Regular coffee | With cream and sugar |
| The Pike | Mass Turnpike (I-90) |
| The T | Subway system |
| Southie | South Boston |
| JP | Jamaica Plain |

### The Accent
Not everyone has it, but you'll hear:
- "Cah" (car)
- "Pahk" (park)
- "Hahvahd" (Harvard)
- Dropped R's are the signature

Working-class neighborhoods (Southie, Dorchester, Charlestown) have strongest accents. Cambridge/Back Bay less so.

## Social Dynamics

### Townies vs. Transplants

**As a newcomer:**
