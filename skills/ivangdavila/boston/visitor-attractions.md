### Freedom Trail
2.5-mile red brick line connecting 16 Revolutionary War sites.

**Cost:** Trail is free. Individual sites $5-15 each.

### Fenway Park
America's oldest MLB stadium (1912). Intimate, historic atmosphere.

### MIT Campus
Walk the Infinite Corridor, see the Stata Center's wild architecture.

### Boston Public Library

**Do:** See the courtyard, Bates Hall reading room, John Singer Sargent murals.
**Free:** Always. Just walk in.
**Time:** 45 minutes.

## Good But Not Essential

### New England Aquarium
Solid aquarium, giant ocean tank centerpiece.

**Worth it for:** Families, rainy days, penguin viewing
**Skip if:** You've seen major aquariums elsewhere
**Cost:** $35 adults
**Tip:** IMAX separate ticket, often skippable

### Museum of Fine Arts
World-class collection, massive building.

**Worth it for:** Art lovers, Impressionist collection, Egyptian wing
**Skip if:** Limited time, prefer history
**Cost:** $27 adults, free Wednesday evenings after 4pm
**Time:** 3+ hours to see highlights

### Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
Venetian-style palace with courtyard, famous art heist story.

### USS Constitution
Oldest commissioned warship still afloat (1797).

### Boston Common and Public Garden

**Time:** 30-60 minutes strolling
**Free:** Always (Swan Boats $4.50)

### Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market
Historic meeting hall plus food hall complex.

**Reality:** Very touristy but decent food court options.
**Do:** Walk through, grab a quick bite if hungry.
**Skip:** Expensive restaurants here. Better options nearby.

## Skip These

### Plymouth Rock
Just a rock with "1620" carved on it. 45 minutes from Boston. Underwhelming.

**Instead:** If you want Pilgrim history, Plimoth Patuxet Museums is better.

### Duck Tours
Overpriced amphibious vehicles with corny narration.

**Reality:** $55 for what you can see walking for free.
**Instead:** Walk the Freedom Trail, take harbor ferry.

### Salem (Most of It)
Witch trial kitsch dominates. Very commercial.

**Exception:** Peabody Essex Museum is legitimately world-class.
**If you go:** Halloween season is mobbed. Off-season quieter.

### Cheers Bar
The TV show was filmed in LA. This is just a bar with merchandise.

**Reality:** Generic bar trading on 1980s sitcom nostalgia.
**Instead:** Literally any actual Boston bar.

### TD Garden Tours
Unless you're seeing a game, it's just an arena.

**Instead:** Fenway Park tour is 100x better.
