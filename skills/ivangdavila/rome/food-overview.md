# Food Scene Overview — Rome

## Roman Cuisine Philosophy

Roman food is about **simplicity, quality ingredients, and tradition**. Unlike other Italian regions, Rome's cuisine is direct and unfussy — few ingredients, perfectly executed.

### The Pillars
1. **Pasta** — The famous quartet: carbonara, cacio e pepe, amatriciana, gricia
2. **Offal** — Former slaughterhouse district tradition (quinto quarto)
3. **Artichokes** — Two ways: alla romana, alla giudia
4. **Pizza** — Roman style: thin and crispy
5. **Aperitivo** — Pre-dinner ritual with drinks and snacks

### Evolution
- **Ancient roots**: Cucina povera (peasant cooking)
- **Testaccio tradition**: Slaughterhouse workers got organ meats
- **Post-war boom**: Carbonara invented (probably)
- **Today**: Traditional + modern, but tradition rules

## The Sacred Four Pastas

### Cacio e Pepe
- **Ingredients**: Pasta, pecorino romano, black pepper
- **That's it**: Three ingredients, incredibly difficult
- **Texture**: Creamy from pasta water + cheese emulsion
- **Test of a restaurant**: Can they make this without clumping?

### Carbonara
- **Ingredients**: Guanciale, egg yolks, pecorino, black pepper
- **NOT cream**: Real carbonara has NO cream
- **NOT bacon**: Guanciale (cured pork cheek) only
- **Texture**: Silky, coating the pasta

### Amatriciana
- **Ingredients**: Guanciale, tomato, pecorino, (optional chili)
- **Origin**: Amatrice, Lazio
- **Character**: Tomato-based, slightly spicy
- **Pasta**: Usually bucatini (thick spaghetti with hole)

### Gricia
- **Ingredients**: Guanciale, pecorino, black pepper
- **Essentially**: Carbonara without egg, amatriciana without tomato
- **The "mother" pasta**: Others derive from this
