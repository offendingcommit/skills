# Roman Cuisine Deep Dive

## The Quinto Quarto Tradition

Roman cuisine is rooted in "quinto quarto" (fifth quarter) — offal and scraps that wealthy Romans gave to slaughterhouse workers. What the rich discarded, the poor made delicious.

**Testaccio** was the slaughterhouse district. The best traditional Roman food still comes from there.

**Why it matters**: Understanding this explains Roman cuisine. These are not "fancy" dishes made simple. They are poor people's food made with skill, time, and tradition.

## The Four Pastas: Mastery Guide

### Cacio e Pepe

**Ingredients** (serves 2):
- 200g tonnarelli or spaghetti
- 150g pecorino romano (finely grated)
- Fresh black pepper (generous)
- Pasta water

**The technique**:
1. Toast pepper in dry pan
2. Cook pasta very al dente, reserve water
3. Create emulsion: cheese + pepper + small amounts of hot pasta water
4. Toss pasta in pan with emulsion
5. Work quickly — cheese clumps if too hot or too cold

**Common failures**:
- Clumpy cheese (temperature wrong)
- Watery sauce (too much water)
- Dry (not enough water)
- Adding cream (sacrilege)

**Where it is done right**:
- Roma Sparita (Trastevere) — served in cheese wheel
- Felice a Testaccio
- Roscioli (Centro)
- Da Enzo (Trastevere)

### Carbonara

**Ingredients** (serves 2):
- 200g rigatoni or spaghetti
- 150g guanciale (not pancetta)
- 4 egg yolks + 1 whole egg
- 50g pecorino romano
- Black pepper

**The technique**:
1. Cut guanciale in strips, render fat slowly
2. Mix yolks, whole egg, most cheese, pepper
3. Cook pasta, reserve water
4. Remove guanciale pan from heat
5. Add drained pasta to guanciale
6. Add egg mixture OFF HEAT
7. Toss vigorously — heat from pasta cooks eggs
8. Add pasta water if needed for creaminess

**Common failures**:
- Scrambled eggs (pan too hot)
- Using bacon or pancetta (wrong flavor)
- Adding cream (never)
- Using whole eggs only (too watery)

**Where it is done right**:
- Roscioli
- Armando al Pantheon
- Pipero Roma (upscale)
- Da Enzo (Trastevere)

### Amatriciana

**Ingredients** (serves 2):
- 200g bucatini or rigatoni
- 150g guanciale
- 400g San Marzano tomatoes
- Pecorino romano
- White wine (optional)
- Red pepper flakes (optional)
- NO GARLIC (controversial but traditional)

**The technique**:
1. Render guanciale, remove
2. Add tomatoes to fat
3. Simmer until thick
4. Return guanciale
5. Toss with pasta
6. Finish with pecorino

**Where it is done right**:
- Matricianella
- Roscioli
- Flavio al Velavevodetto (Testaccio)

### Gricia

**Often called**: White amatriciana or carbonara's grandfather

**Ingredients** (serves 2):
- 200g rigatoni
- 150g guanciale
- Pecorino romano
- Black pepper
- Pasta water

**The technique**:
1. Render guanciale slowly
2. Reserve fat
3. Create emulsion with pecorino and pasta water
4. Toss pasta with guanciale and emulsion

**Less famous but equally important.** Many Romans consider it the purest test of technique.

## The Rules (Seriously)

1. **No cream in carbonara.** Ever.
2. **No garlic in amatriciana** (controversial but traditional).
3. **Pecorino, not parmesan** on Roman pasta.
4. **Guanciale, not pancetta** for carbonara/amatriciana/gricia.
5. **Cappuccino only until 11am.**
6. **Pasta is primo** — not a main course, eaten before secondo.
7. **Bread is not for dipping** in oil (that is Tuscan).
8. **Cheese never with seafood** (don't ask for parmesan on spaghetti alle vongole).

## Vegetarian Notes

Roman cuisine is meat-heavy, but options exist:

**Naturally vegetarian**:
- Cacio e pepe
- Carciofi (both styles)
- Fiori di zucca (without anchovy — ask)
- Vignarola (spring vegetables)
- Pasta with seasonal vegetables

**Challenge**: Many dishes use guanciale/meat bases
**Communication**: "Sono vegetariano" helps, but check ingredients
