## The Gentrification Reality

All these neighborhoods are changing:

**Testaccio**: Most stable identity; working-class pride resists complete transformation

**Pigneto**: Rapidly changing; original residents being pushed out; becoming what it replaced

**San Lorenzo**: University keeps it young but not wealthy; somewhat protected

**Ostiense**: Blank canvas being filled; unclear what it becomes

**Timeline**: What is trendy today may be generic in 5 years. The cycle continues.

**Advice**: Enjoy them now. The Rome you experience will not be the Rome of 2030.
