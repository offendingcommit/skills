# Rome International and Fine Dining

## The International Scene

Rome is not Paris or London for international cuisine. Italians believe their food is best (they have a point). But options exist and are improving.

### Reality Check
- International options concentrated in certain areas
- Quality varies dramatically
- Many "ethnic" restaurants are mediocre
- Fine dining scene growing but still behind Milan
- Romans skeptical of non-Italian cuisine

---

## Asian Cuisine

### Chinese

**Esquilino/Piazza Vittorio area** — Rome's Chinatown

**Worth trying**:
- **Hang Zhou** — Best Chinese in Rome, Zhejiang cuisine
- **Palato Cinese** — Modern Chinese, good dim sum
- **Chinatown area** various — Authentic, cheap

**Quality range**: Excellent at top spots, inconsistent elsewhere

### Japanese

Growing scene, still developing.

**Recommended**:
- **Sakana Sushi** — Quality omakase
- **Sushisen** — Long-established, reliable
- **Ramen spots** emerging (Akira, Hamasei)

**Note**: Sushi in Rome is generally below international standards. Manage expectations.

### Thai/Vietnamese/Southeast Asian

Limited but improving.

**Options**:
- **Thai** — Thien Kim (Esquilino), some quality spots in Prati
- **Vietnamese** — Limited, Noodle House attempts
- **General SE Asian** — Scarce quality options

### Indian

**Esquilino area** has concentration.

**Worth trying**:
- **Indian Affairs** — Higher-end, reliable
- **Maharajah** — Long-established
- **Various on Via Giolitti** — Mixed quality

**Challenge**: Many are quite basic. True quality Indian rare.

## Middle Eastern and Mediterranean

### Middle Eastern

Growing scene, especially in multicultural areas.

**Worth trying**:
- **Open Baladin** — Falafel, Middle Eastern inspired
- **Various in Esquilino/Pigneto** — Shawarma, kebab
- **Quality hummus spots emerging**

### Greek

**Limited presence** — Romans don't travel to Greece mentally.

### Turkish

- Kebab shops everywhere (quality varies)
- Few proper Turkish restaurants

---

## American and International Casual

### Burgers

Romans have embraced burgers.

**Worth trying**:
- **Open Baladin** — Craft beer focus, good burgers
- **Burger Italia** — Popular chain, decent
- **Various American-style spots** in Trastevere, Monti

### Brunch

Slowly catching on (not traditional Italian).

**Brunch spots**:
- **Coromandel** (Monti)
- **Romeow Cat Bistrot** (Ostiense) — Yes, cat cafe
- **Various in Pigneto, Monti**

**Note**: Traditional Romans find "brunch" concept strange.

### Mexican

**Very limited** quality options.

- **Chihuahua Tacos** — Decent attempt
- **Most "Mexican"** — Tex-Mex at best

### What to Expect

- Extensive wine lists
- Quality cheese and salumi

### Reality

- Many Roman dishes naturally vegetarian (cacio e pepe, carciofi)
- Restaurants generally accommodating if you ask
- Vegan harder (cheese, eggs in everything)
- Learn: "Sono vegetariano/vegano" helps

## Pizza Beyond Roman Style

### Neapolitan Pizza in Rome

- **Seu Pizza Illuminati** — Top quality, inventive
- **Pizzeria Tonda** — Solid Neapolitan
- **Pizzeria Ostiense** — Good option

### Roman vs Neapolitan

| Roman | Neapolitan |
|-------|------------|
| Thin, crispy | Thick, soft edge |
| Sold by slice/weight | Whole pizzas |
| Crunchy throughout | Charred, chewy |
| Various toppings | Classic emphasis |

## Practical for International

### Where to Find Variety

**Esquilino/Termini area**: Most multicultural, Chinese, Indian, etc.
**Pigneto**: Some international, trendy
**Monti/Centro**: Fine dining, upscale international
**Trastevere**: Tourist international (mixed quality)

### Quality Signals

**Good signs**:
- Busy with locals (of that cuisine)
- Specific regional focus (not "Asian" but "Cantonese")
- Fresh ingredients visible
- Not on main tourist street

**Bad signs**:
- Empty at meal times
- Photos of food outside
- "International menu" with everything
- Very cheap in expensive area

### Expectations Management

Rome is not:
- **New York** for diversity
- **London** for quality international
- **Berlin** for casual international

Rome is excellent for:
- Italian cuisine (obviously)
- Mediterranean flavors
- Growing fine dining scene
- Wine culture

**Recommendation**: Eat Italian most meals. Save international for when you need a break.
