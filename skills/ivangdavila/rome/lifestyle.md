## The Bottom Line

Rome is not for everyone. It will frustrate you. Things will take longer. You will struggle.

But if you give it time, learn the language, and embrace the culture, it can become home in a way few places can.

Romans have a saying: "Roma non si discute, si ama." 
Rome is not discussed, it is loved.

You won't understand it at first. Given time, you might.
