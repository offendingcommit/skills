# Choosing a Neighborhood — Rome

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Define Your Non-Negotiables

| Priority | Best Areas | Avoid |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Walk to sights | Centro Storico, Monti, Trastevere | EUR, Outer areas |
| Best food | Testaccio, Trastevere, Jewish Ghetto | EUR, Termini |
| Nightlife | Trastevere, Testaccio, Pigneto | Parioli, EUR |
| Family-friendly | Parioli, EUR, Monteverde | San Lorenzo, Pigneto |
| Budget | Garbatella, EUR, Esquilino | Centro, Parioli |
| Quiet | Aventino, Parioli, Monteverde | Trastevere, Centro |
| Expat community | Trastevere, Prati, Testaccio | Outer areas |
| Metro access | San Giovanni, Prati, EUR | Trastevere, Aventino |

### Step 2: Budget Reality Check

| Monthly Rent | What You Get |
|--------------|--------------|
| EUR 600-800 | Outer areas, shared apartments, basic |
| EUR 800-1,100 | Residential neighborhoods, decent |
| EUR 1,100-1,500 | Good neighborhoods, nice apartments |
| EUR 1,500-2,000 | Centro, upscale areas, quality |
| EUR 2,000+ | Luxury, prime Centro, Parioli |

**Rule of thumb:** Expect to spend 30-40% of income on rent. Higher in Rome than elsewhere in Italy.

### Step 3: Commute Consideration

**If working in Centro:**
- Trastevere: 15-20 min walk
- Testaccio: 20-30 min walk/bus
- San Giovanni: 20 min metro
- EUR: 30+ min metro

**If working remote:**
- Wifi quality varies by building
- Co-working spaces in Monti, Pigneto, Ostiense
- Coffee shop culture strong (but not for working)
