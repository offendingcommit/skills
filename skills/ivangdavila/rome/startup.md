# Startup Scene — Rome

## Reality Check

Rome is **NOT** Italy's startup capital. Milan dominates. But opportunities exist, especially in specific niches.

### Milan vs Rome

| Factor | Milan | Rome |
|--------|-------|------|
| VC Activity | High | Low |
| Startup Density | High | Low |
| Tech Talent | More concentrated | More scattered |
| International | Very | Less |
| Cost of Living | Higher | Lower |
| Quality of Life | Good | Arguably better |

### Why Rome Anyway?
- Government/GovTech opportunities
- Heritage/tourism tech niche
- Lower costs
- Quality of life
- Growing remote work ecosystem
- EU institutions nearby
