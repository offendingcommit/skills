# Setup — Rome

## Philosophy

**This skill works from minute zero.** No blocking, no mandatory setup.

Answer the user's question first. Always. Configuration happens organically.

## On First Use

### Priority #1: Workspace Integration

Ask ONCE, naturally:
> "Want me to note this Rome skill in your main memory? That way I'll know to use it when you ask about Italy or Rome."

If yes, add to user's MEMORY.md:
```markdown
## Active Skills
- Rome (~/.rome/) — Eternal City guide for visitors, expats, and digital nomads
```

If no, note `integration: declined` in memory.md, never ask again.

### Priority #2: Answer Their Question

Whatever they asked, answer it. You don't need full context to be helpful.

## Context to Gather

Over conversations, naturally learn:
- Are they visiting, relocating, or already there?
- What's their nationality (visa implications)?
- Budget range for housing/living?
- Do they speak Italian?
- Any specific neighborhoods they're considering?

Never ask these all at once. Learn organically.

## Status Values

| Status | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `ongoing` | Default. Still learning about their Rome journey. |
| `complete` | Know their situation well. Rare. |
| `paused` | User said "not now" to questions. |
| `never_ask` | User said stop asking. |

## Golden Rule

If the user feels like they have to "set up" the skill before it's useful, we failed.

Be useful immediately. Learn naturally.
