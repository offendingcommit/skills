# Roman Cuisine Essentials

## The Four Pastas (I Quattro)

### Cacio e Pepe
**The ultimate test of a Roman restaurant**

- **Ingredients**: Pasta (tonnarelli or spaghetti), pecorino romano, black pepper
- **Technique**: Pasta water emulsified with cheese and pepper
- **Perfect execution**: Creamy, not clumpy, pepper distributed
- **Why it's hard**: Temperature, timing, water starch content

**Where to eat it:**
- Felice a Testaccio (legendary)
- Da Enzo al 29 (excellent)
- Flavio al Velavevodetto (consistent)
- Tonnarello (good, large portions)

### Carbonara
**Rome's most famous export (probably invented mid-20th century)**

- **Ingredients**: Guanciale, egg yolks, pecorino, black pepper
- **NOT ALLOWED**: Cream, onions, garlic, bacon
- **Perfect execution**: Silky sauce, guanciale crispy but not burned
- **Common mistakes**: Scrambled eggs, heavy

**Where to eat it:**
- Roscioli (top tier)
- Da Danilo (carbonara specialists)
- Da Felice (classic)
- Piperno (old school)

### Amatriciana
**From Amatrice, Lazio's mountain town**

- **Ingredients**: Guanciale, tomato (San Marzano or similar), pecorino, (optional peperoncino)
- **Pasta**: Traditionally bucatini (thick with hole)
- **Character**: Tomato-forward, slight heat
- **Variations**: White wine sometimes

**Where to eat it:**
- Bucatino (named for the pasta)
- Da Felice
- Trattoria Da Lucia (Trastevere)

### Gricia
**The "white amatriciana" — perhaps the original**

- **Ingredients**: Guanciale, pecorino, black pepper
- **Texture**: Fatty, rich, cheese coating
- **Relationship**: Carbonara minus egg, amatriciana minus tomato
- **Less famous**: But equally important

**Where to eat it:**
- Da Felice
- Flavio al Velavevodetto
- Any serious Roman trattoria

## Offal (Quinto Quarto)

### The Fifth Quarter
Testaccio, near the old slaughterhouse, developed cuisine around organ meats — what workers were paid with.

### Dishes to Try

**Trippa alla Romana**
- Tripe in tomato sauce with mint and pecorino
- Saturday dish traditionally
- Where: Felice, Checchino dal 1887

**Coda alla Vaccinara**
- Oxtail braised in tomato, celery, cocoa
- Rich, falling-off-bone tender
- Where: Checchino dal 1887 (originated here)

**Pajata**
- Intestines of milk-fed calf
- With rigatoni usually
- Intense, not for beginners
- Where: Checchino, serious trattorias

**Coratella**
- Lamb offal (heart, lungs, liver)
- Often with artichokes
- Easter traditional dish
- Where: Testaccio Market, Flavio

### Not Into Offal?
That's fine — most restaurants offer plenty of non-offal options. But if adventurous, Testaccio is the place.
