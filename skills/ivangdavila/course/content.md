# Course Content Creation

## Curriculum Design

**Module structure (recommended):**
```
Module: [Topic Name]
├── Objective: What they'll be able to DO after this module
├── Lessons: 3-5 lessons of 10-20 minutes each
├── Assessment: How to verify learning (quiz, exercise, project)
└── Resources: Downloads, references, tools
```

**Lesson structure:**
1. Hook — Why this matters (1-2 min)
2. Core content — Main teaching (8-12 min)
3. Example/demonstration — Show it working (3-5 min)
4. Exercise prompt — What to practice (1 min)
5. Summary — Key takeaways (1 min)

**Curriculum validation checklist:**
- [ ] Clear transformation promise (student goes from A to B)
- [ ] Logical progression (each module builds on previous)
- [ ] Appropriate scope (completable in stated timeframe)
- [ ] Assessment at each stage (not just final)
- [ ] Practical exercises (not just theory)


## Transforming Existing Materials

### From Recordings

**Process:**
1. Transcribe all recordings (agent handles this)
2. Identify unique topics/themes across recordings
3. Group related segments under module topics
4. Fill gaps where coverage is thin
5. Create clean scripts from best explanations

**Common issues:**
- Tangents and stories → Keep if illustrative, cut if off-topic
- Repetition across recordings → Consolidate into single best version
- Q&A mixed in → Separate into FAQ or weave into relevant lessons


### From Written Materials

**Process:**
1. Outline structure from existing documents
2. Identify what's missing for complete learning
3. Expand bullet points into full explanations
4. Add examples, exercises, assessments
5. Convert text-heavy content to visual/video where appropriate

**Document types:**
| Type | Best transformation |
|------|---------------------|
| Technical docs | Video walkthroughs + downloadable reference |
| Slide decks | Voiceover narration + expanded notes |
| Blog posts | Organized modules + additional exercises |
| Checklists | Interactive worksheets + video explanation |


## Assessment Design

**Quiz best practices:**
- 5-10 questions per module
- Mix recall (facts) and application (scenarios)
- Immediate feedback with explanations
- Passing threshold 70-80%

**Exercise types:**
| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| Multiple choice | Factual knowledge, quick check |
| Scenario/case | Application of concepts |
| Hands-on project | Skill demonstration |
| Peer review | Complex work, learning from others |
| Self-assessment | Reflection, soft skills |

**Certification criteria:**
- Complete all modules (not just watch)
- Pass assessments above threshold
- Submit required projects
- Optional: peer evaluation or final exam


## Content Quality Checklist

Before publishing any lesson:
- [ ] Clear learning objective stated
- [ ] Single focused topic (not multiple concepts jammed together)
- [ ] Appropriate length (10-20 min max)
- [ ] At least one concrete example
- [ ] Practice opportunity included
- [ ] Technical quality acceptable (audio, video, slides)
- [ ] Downloads/resources provided where relevant
