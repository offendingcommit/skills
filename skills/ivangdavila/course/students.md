## Progress Tracking & Nudges

**Engagement states:**
| State | Definition | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Active | Logged in last 7 days | Nothing needed |
| Slowing | 7-14 days inactive | Gentle reminder |
| At-risk | 14-30 days inactive | Personalized outreach |
| Dormant | 30+ days inactive | Re-engagement campaign |

**Automated nudge sequence:**
- Day 7: "We noticed you haven't logged in — here's a quick win from Module 2"
- Day 14: "Students who complete Module 1 in week 2 are X% more likely to finish"
- Day 21: "Reply to this email and tell me what's blocking you"
- Day 30: "Your course access is waiting — here's what you're missing"


## Community Management

**Community structure:**
- Welcome/introductions channel
- General discussion
- Module-specific channels (for focused help)
- Wins/testimonials (social proof + motivation)
- Resources/extras

**Moderation rules to automate:**
- Auto-welcome new members with guidelines
- Flag posts with negative sentiment for review
- Highlight valuable contributions
- Remove spam/promotional content
- Escalate urgent issues to instructor

**Community health metrics:**
- Daily active members
- Posts per week
- Response time (how fast questions get answered)
- Member retention (30/60/90 day)


## Completion & Certification

**Certificate criteria:**

**Post-completion:**
1. Request testimonial (video or written)
