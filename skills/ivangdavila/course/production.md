# Course Production

## Video Production

### Pre-production (Agent handles)
- Write scripts from curriculum outline
- Create slide templates
- Prepare shot lists/talking points
- Design thumbnails and titles

### Production (User does, Agent supports)
- Recording: User records based on script
- Agent provides prompts and cues
- Multiple takes → Agent selects best

### Post-production (Agent handles)
- Basic editing: Cut dead air, mistakes, long pauses
- Add intros/outros from template
- Insert title cards and transitions
- Generate subtitles/captions
- Export for platform specs

### Quality standards
| Element | Minimum | Recommended |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Resolution | 720p | 1080p |
| Audio | Clear, no echo | Dedicated mic |
| Lighting | Visible face | Even, professional |
| Length | 5-25 min | 10-15 min |


## Slide/Presentation Creation

**From script to slides:**
1. Extract key points from lesson script
2. One main idea per slide (not walls of text)
3. Visual support: diagrams, screenshots, examples
4. Consistent template: colors, fonts, layout
5. Speaker notes with full talking points

**Slide templates by lesson type:**
- **Concept explanation:** Title → Definition → Example → Application
- **Process/How-to:** Overview → Steps 1-N → Common mistakes → Summary
- **Case study:** Context → Problem → Approach → Results → Lessons


## Supporting Materials

### Downloadable resources
| Type | Purpose | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| Summary PDF | Quick reference | 1-2 page PDF |
| Worksheet | Practice exercises | Fillable PDF |
| Checklist | Action items | PDF or interactive |
| Template | Starting point for work | Word/Excel/etc |
| Transcript | Accessibility, review | PDF or text |

### Resource creation workflow
1. Identify what students need to apply lesson
2. Create template that accelerates their work
3. Include instructions for use
4. Provide completed example if helpful
5. Format for easy printing/use


## Batch Production Workflow

**For efficiency, batch similar tasks:**

Week 1: All scripts written
Week 2: All slides created  
Week 3: All recordings done
Week 4: All editing complete
Week 5: All resources created
Week 6: Platform upload and testing

**Why batching works:**
- Same mental mode across similar tasks
- Equipment setup done once
- Consistent quality across course
- Easier to track progress


## Platform Upload Checklist

For each lesson before going live:
- [ ] Video uploaded and processed
- [ ] Correct module and lesson order
- [ ] Thumbnail set
- [ ] Description/summary added
- [ ] Downloads attached
