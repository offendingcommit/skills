# Course Creation by Audience Type

## Expert/Professional (Doctor, Lawyer, Engineer, etc.)

**Profile:** Deep expertise, limited time, wants to monetize knowledge, may not know how to structure for learning.

**Key needs:**
- Extract curriculum from scattered materials (conference talks, papers, client notes)
- Translate technical knowledge into accessible content
- Validate market demand before investing production time
- Automate student support to avoid 1:1 time drain

**Workflow:**
1. Gather all existing materials (recordings, presentations, notes)
2. Agent extracts themes and proposes module structure
3. User records core lessons (agent provides scripts)
4. Agent handles production, platform, marketing, support
5. User only intervenes for complex student questions

**Common mistakes to prevent:**
- Overcomplicating with jargon → Simplify for audience level
- Trying to teach everything → Focus on one transformation
- Underpricing expertise → Benchmark against similar courses


## Educator/Professor

**Profile:** Teaching experience, existing curriculum, wants to digitize or scale, knows pedagogy but not tech/marketing.

**Key needs:**
- Transform existing materials (syllabi, slides, handouts) into online format
- Adapt in-person teaching to asynchronous learning
- Automated grading and progress tracking
- Maintain academic rigor while adding engagement

**Workflow:**
1. Import existing course materials (PDFs, slides, recordings)
2. Agent restructures for online consumption (shorter modules, more exercises)
3. Generate quizzes, assignments, rubrics from content
4. Set up automated feedback and progress reports
5. Agent handles repetitive student questions

**Key transformations:**
- 90-min lectures → 3-4 focused 15-min modules
- Paper handouts → Interactive worksheets with answer checking
- In-class discussions → Forum prompts with AI moderation
- Final exams → Progressive assessments throughout

**Workflow:**
1. Audit existing content for course potential
2. Identify gaps to fill and structure into curriculum
3. Agent creates all marketing assets (sales page, emails, social clips)
4. Automate launch sequence and cart open/close
5. Scale community support without creator bottleneck

**Launch sequence automation:**

- Close: Urgency, last chance, social proof
- Evergreen: Automated funnel with periodic launches
