## Multi-Platform Strategy

**Week 1:** List on 2-3 platforms
- eBay (shipped) + FB Marketplace (local) minimum
- Category-specific platform if applicable

**If no bites after week 2:**
- Add Craigslist, OfferUp
- Share to local Facebook groups
- Consider consignment for high-value items

**Mark as sold everywhere** when it sells to avoid double-selling headaches.
