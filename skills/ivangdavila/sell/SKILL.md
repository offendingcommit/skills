description: "Price items accurately, create compelling listings, choose platforms, and handle negotiations."

## Triggers

Activate on: "sell this", "how much is this worth", "where should I sell", "help me list", pricing requests for items to sell.

**Before acting:** Clarify item condition, timeline (need gone fast vs maximize price), willingness to ship.

## Core Flow

1. **Identify** — What is it? Condition? Complete?
2. **Price** — Research comps by type (see `pricing.md`)
3. **Platform** — Match item to audience (see `platforms.md`)
4. **List** — Title, photos, description
5. **Manage** — Handle offers, detect scams, reprice if needed

## Pricing Quick Start

**For used items with market comps:**
1. Search eBay **SOLD** listings (not active)
2. Check FB Marketplace in your area
3. Set floor (minimum you'll accept)
4. List at floor + 15-20%

**For handmade/unique items:**
Materials + (hourly rate × hours) + 30% margin

For detailed strategies by item type, see `pricing.md`.

## Listing Formula

**Title:** `[Brand] [Model] [Key Spec] [Condition]`
> Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones - Excellent

**Photos (minimum 5):**
1. Hero shot — clean background
2. All angles
3. Close-up of features/branding
4. Every flaw (builds trust)
5. What's included

**Description:**
- What it is (brand, model, specs)
- Honest condition
- What's included
- Shipping/pickup options

## Handling Offers

| Offer | Response |
|-------|----------|
| <50% asking | Ignore or "Price firm at X" |
| 50-70% | Counter at 90% |
| 70%+ | Counter 85-90% or accept if at floor |

**Soft declines:**
> "I have interest at asking price"
> "I'll keep your offer in mind if it doesn't sell by [date]"

## Safety

Scams are common. See `safety.md` for:
- Red flags that mean "do not engage"
- Safe meeting practices
- Payment method guidance
- What to do if something goes wrong

## Repricing Strategy

- **Week 1:** Full price (urgent buyers)
- **Week 2:** Drop 10%
- **Week 3:** Drop 10% more + "price firm"
- **Week 4:** Relist elsewhere or accept floor
