# Scaling Fiverr Operations: 20+ Orders/Month

## Unified Order Tracking

Track all orders in one view:

| Order ID | Gig | Client | Due | Status | Assigned | Notes |
|----------|-----|--------|-----|--------|----------|-------|
| FO123 | Logo | @buyer1 | 4h | Revision | Self | Wants darker blue |
| FO456 | Video | @buyer2 | 18h | Waiting | VA-1 | Needs source files |

### Status Categories
- **New**: Just received, review requirements
- **Gathering**: Waiting for client info/files
- **In Progress**: Work started
- **Review**: Internal QA before delivery
- **Delivered**: Sent, awaiting acceptance
- **Revision**: Changes requested
- **Complete**: Accepted + paid
- **Dispute**: Problem escalated

## Communication at Scale

### Response Templates (With Variations)
Never send identical messages. Each template needs 3-5 variations:

**Order Received - Variation 1:**
> "Thanks for your order! I've reviewed your requirements and I'm excited to get started. Expect your first update within [X hours]. Quick question: [specific clarification]?"

**Order Received - Variation 2:**
> "Great to work with you! I'm diving into your project now. I'll check in with progress by [time]. One thing I wanted to confirm: [specific clarification]"

**Order Received - Variation 3:**
> "Appreciate you choosing me for this project! Your requirements look clear—I'll have an update for you by [time]. Just to make sure we're aligned: [specific clarification]"

### Response Timing Rules
- **Don't respond instantly** every time (looks automated)
- Vary between 5-30 minutes during "work hours"
- Occasional 1-2 hour delays are natural
- Set "away" status during off hours

## VA/Team Coordination

### Order Handoff Document
When assigning to VA, compile:
1. Client requirements (cleaned up from messages)
2. Reference files (downloaded, organized)
3. Deadline (with buffer for your review)
4. Style notes from conversation
5. Any red flags to watch

### QA Checklist Before Delivery
- [ ] Matches all stated requirements
- [ ] File formats as specified
- [ ] Named files professionally
- [ ] Checked for obvious errors
- [ ] Delivery message drafted

## Financial Tracking

### Fee Structure
- 20% platform fee on all earnings (including tips)
- Payment processing varies by method
- Clearance period: 14 days (7 for Top Rated)

### Monthly P&L Template
```
Gross Revenue: $X,XXX
- Fiverr Fees (20%): -$XXX
Net to Account: $X,XXX
- VA Costs: -$XXX
- Tool Subscriptions: -$XX
Actual Profit: $X,XXX (XX% margin)
```

### Effective Hourly Rate
Track time per gig type to ensure profitability:
- Logo Basic: 1.5h avg → $25/1.5h = $16.67/h (after fees: $13.33)
- If below target rate → raise price or streamline process

## Automation Safety

### What Fiverr Detects
- Identical message text sent repeatedly
- Response times consistently under 30 seconds
- Login from multiple IPs simultaneously
- Unusual activity patterns

### Safe Practices
- Use template variations, never exact copies
- Add natural delays (5-30 min typical)
- One IP/device per account
- Human final approval on all sends
- Never automate: deliveries, cancellations, disputes
