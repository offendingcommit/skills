# Central Barcelona — Ciutat Vella

The old city, divided into distinct neighborhoods with very different characters.

## 1. El Born (La Ribera)

**Best for**: Young professionals, foodies, nightlife lovers, culture seekers

**Character**: Barcelona's trendiest neighborhood. Medieval streets meet hip bars and boutiques. Picasso Museum, Santa Maria del Mar, excellent restaurants. Buzzy but not as touristy as Gòtic.

| Rent | 1BR: €1,400–1,900 | 2BR: €1,800–2,600 |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|

**Pros**: Best dining/bar scene, beautiful architecture, Picasso Museum, walking distance to beach
**Cons**: Noisy weekends, tourist traffic increasing, no parking, expensive

**Transit**: Jaume I (L4), Arc de Triomf (L1), Barceloneta (L4)
**Must-do**: Passeig del Born evening drinks, Santa Maria del Mar, brunch at Federal

---

## 2. Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter)

**Best for**: History lovers, tourists wanting central location, short-term stays

**Character**: Medieval heart of Barcelona. Roman walls, narrow streets, Cathedral. Most touristy area but undeniably beautiful. Avoid for long-term living.

| Rent | 1BR: €1,300–1,800 | 2BR: €1,700–2,400 |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|

**Pros**: Historic atmosphere, central to everything, great architecture, walkable
**Cons**: Extremely touristy, pickpockets, noise, few real neighbors, overpriced everything

**Transit**: Jaume I (L4), Liceu (L3), Catalunya (L1, L3)
**Must-do**: Cathedral morning visit, Plaça Reial (despite tourists), early morning empty streets

### Sub-areas:
- **Upper Gòtic** (near Cathedral): Most touristy
- **Lower Gòtic** (near port): Slightly quieter
- **Plaça Reial**: Beautiful but very touristy

## 3. El Raval

**Best for**: Budget-conscious creatives, nightlife seekers, multicultural experience

**Character**: Barcelona's most diverse and controversial neighborhood. Historically rough but gentrifying. MACBA, excellent international food, vibrant nightlife. Edgy aesthetic.

| Rent | 1BR: €1,000–1,400 | 2BR: €1,300–1,800 |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|

**Pros**: Cheapest in center, amazing food diversity, MACBA, authentic multicultural vibe, nightlife
**Cons**: Safety concerns (some blocks), gritty, drug dealing visible in parts, requires street awareness

**Transit**: Liceu (L3), Sant Antoni (L2), Drassanes (L3), Universitat (L1, L2)
**Must-do**: MACBA plaza (skateboarders), Mercat de la Boqueria (morning), cocktails at upper Raval

### Areas within Raval:
- **Upper Raval** (near MACBA): Gentrified, trendy, safer
- **Lower Raval** (near Drassanes): Grittier, caution at night
- **Rambla del Raval**: Central spine, improving
- **Sant Pau area**: Historic hospital, quiet

**Safety note**: Upper Raval around MACBA/Universitat is fine. Lower Raval below Carrer de l'Hospital requires more awareness, especially at night. Petty crime exists throughout.

## 4. Barceloneta

**Best for**: Beach lovers, those wanting Mediterranean lifestyle, short-term

**Character**: Former fishermen's quarter, now tourist magnet. Beach access, seafood, narrow streets with hanging laundry. Authentic character being eroded by tourism.

|------|-------------------|-------------------|

**Pros**: Beach at doorstep, seafood restaurants, unique atmosphere, port access

**Must-do**: Morning coffee at beach chiringuito, Can Paixano for cava + tapas

## 5. Sant Pere, Santa Caterina

**Best for**: Those wanting El Born feel without El Born prices

**Character**: Often lumped with El Born but distinct. Santa Caterina market, artisan streets, slightly quieter. Good value alternative to Born proper.

| Rent | 1BR: €1,200–1,700 | 2BR: €1,500–2,200 |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
