## Finding Housing

### The Reality

Barcelona has a **severe housing shortage**. Competition is intense. Be prepared to:
- Decide quickly (good flats go in hours)
- Have all documents ready
- Consider short-term first, then search locally
- Face multiple rejections

### The Rental Process

| Step | What Happens | Duration |
|------|--------------|----------|
| 1. Search | Idealista, Fotocasa, Badi | 1-3 weeks |
| 2. Viewing | Contact, schedule (act fast!) | Same day |
| 3. Application | Submit documents immediately | Hours |
| 4. Contract | Review, sign (Catalan or Spanish) | 1-2 days |
| 5. Move-in | Pay deposit + first month | Agreed date |

### Documents Required

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Passport/ID** | Identity |
| **NIE** | Tax ID (or promise to obtain) |
| **Employment contract** | Proof of income |
| **Last 3 payslips** | Income verification |
| **Bank statements** | Financial health |
| **Aval (guarantor)** | Often required for foreigners |

**Newcomer challenges:**
- No NIE yet → some landlords accept promise
- No Spanish payslips → offer larger deposit, guarantor
- Competition → respond within hours, not days

### Deposit Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Standard deposit** | 1-2 months rent |
| **Maximum legal** | 2 months for residential |
| **Return timeline** | Within 1 month of leaving |

|------|--------|
| **Deposit (fiança)** | 1-2 months |
| **First month** | Due on signing |
| **Agency fee (if used)** | 1 month + 21% IVA |
| **Total** | 3-4 months rent |
