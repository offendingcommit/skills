# Beach & East Barcelona — Sant Martí

## 1. Poblenou

**Best for**: Tech workers (22@), remote workers, those wanting beach + modern vibe

**Character**: Barcelona's transformation story. Former industrial "Manchester of Spain" now tech hub with beaches. Rambla del Poblenou has village feel, 22@ has startups and multinationals. Best of both worlds.

| Rent | 1BR: €1,200–1,600 | 2BR: €1,500–2,100 |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|

**Pros**: Beach access, tech jobs nearby, improving rapidly, less touristy beaches, modern amenities
**Cons**: Still developing (some blocks empty/industrial), fewer "old Barcelona" charm, can feel sterile in 22@

**Transit**: Poblenou (L4), Llacuna (L4), Bogatell (L4), Selva de Mar (L4)
**Must-do**: Rambla del Poblenou evening walk, Bogatell beach, coffee in Palo Alto complex

### Sub-areas:
- **Rambla del Poblenou**: Village feel, restaurants, charming
- **22@**: Tech/startup hub, modern offices, can feel corporate
- **Beach side**: Near Bogatell/Mar Bella, great for beach access
- **El Clot border**: More residential, more affordable
