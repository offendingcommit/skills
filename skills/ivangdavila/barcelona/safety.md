## Crime by Type

### Pickpocketing (VERY Common)

Barcelona is notorious for this. It's organized, professional, and targets tourists specifically.

|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Las Ramblas** | ★★★★★ | Distraction, crowding |
| **Metro (L3 especially)** | ★★★★★ | Rush hour crowds |
| **La Boqueria** | ★★★★☆ | Shopping distraction |

| **Barceloneta beach** | ★★★★☆ | Unattended belongings |
| **Plaça Catalunya** | ★★★★☆ | Crowds, metro entrances |
| **Park Güell** | ★★★☆☆ | Tourist concentration |

### Prevention (CRITICAL)

| Strategy | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Cross-body bag, zip facing body** | Hardest to open |
| **Phone in FRONT pocket** | Back pocket = easy target |
| **Backpack to front in crowds** | Or skip backpack entirely |
| **Don't stop for strangers** | Most approaches = distraction |
| **No phone on table** | Grab-and-run common |
| **Hand on bag in metro** | Be constantly aware |
| **Nothing in back pocket** | Ever |
| **Keep passport in hotel safe** | Carry copy only |

### "Triangle Rojo" (Red Triangle)

The metro area between Catalunya, Universitat, and Passeig de Gràcia has highest pickpocket concentration. Be especially alert here.

### Beach Theft (VERY Common)

| Problem | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| **Unattended belongings** | NEVER leave anything, even for 2 min |
| **While swimming** | Take turns — someone watches stuff |
| **Sleeping on beach** | Wake up without wallet |
| **Chiringuito (beach bar)** | Bag on lap, not sand |

**Solution:** Waterproof pouch for phone/cards, take in water. Leave nothing of value at beach.

| Method | Where | Prevention |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Moped snatch | Near curb | Phone away when walking |

### Scams (Tourist-Targeting)

| Scam | How It Works | Response |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Petition signers** | Distract while accomplice steals | "No" and keep walking |
| **Rose/bracelet sellers** | Force item → demand payment | Firm "No", don't touch |
| **Found ring** | "Is this yours?" → distraction | Ignore completely |
| **Bird droppings** | Someone "helps" clean → pickpockets | Decline help, walk away |
| **Fake police** | Ask for wallet to "check" | Ask credentials, offer to go to station |
| **Shell game** | Street gambling → rigged | Never play, crowd are shills |
| **Free drinks at club** | Drugged → robbed | Only drink what you order/see poured |
| **Apartment scams** | Pay deposit → no apartment | Never pay without seeing |

---

### Accommodation Scams

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| Price too good | Scam |
| Payment before viewing | Scam |
| "I'm abroad, wire money" | Classic scam |
| No video call possible | Suspicious |
| Pressure to decide fast | Red flag |
