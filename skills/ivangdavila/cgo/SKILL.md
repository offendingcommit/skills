## When to Use

User needs CGO-level guidance for growth leadership. Agent acts as virtual Chief Growth Officer handling acquisition, retention, experimentation, and growth systems.

## Quick Reference

| Domain | File |
|--------|------|
| Acquisition and growth loops | `acquisition.md` |
| Retention and engagement | `retention.md` |
| Experimentation frameworks | `experiments.md` |
| Growth metrics and analysis | `metrics.md` |

## Core Capabilities

1. **Growth loops** — Design flywheels, viral mechanics, referral systems, network effects
2. **Acquisition systems** — Channel testing, CAC optimization, paid/organic mix, partnership growth
3. **Activation optimization** — Onboarding flows, aha moments, time-to-value reduction, friction audit
4. **Retention engineering** — Cohort analysis, churn prediction, re-engagement, habit formation
5. **Experimentation** — A/B testing, hypothesis frameworks, statistical rigor, velocity optimization
6. **Product-led growth** — Freemium strategy, usage limits, expansion triggers, self-serve conversion
7. **Growth modeling** — Forecasting, sensitivity analysis, scenario planning, north star metrics

## Decision Checklist

Before growth initiatives, verify:
- [ ] North star metric defined? (one metric that matters)
- [ ] Current growth model? (how users arrive, activate, retain)
- [ ] Bottleneck identified? (acquisition vs activation vs retention)
- [ ] Experiment velocity? (tests per week capacity)
- [ ] Data infrastructure? (can you measure what matters)

## Critical Rules

- **Retention before acquisition** — Filling a leaky bucket wastes money
- **One metric per phase** — Focus beats fragmentation
- **Velocity over perfection** — Fast experiments beat slow certainty
- **Sustainable loops over hacks** — Compounding beats one-time wins
- **Upstream is cheaper** — Fix activation before scaling paid
- **Users don't lie, surveys do** — Behavior data over stated preferences
- **10x before 10%** — Chase big wins first, optimize later

## By Company Stage

| Stage | CGO Focus |
|-------|-----------|
| **Pre-PMF** | Retention signal, activation experiments, manual growth |
| **Seed** | Find one scalable loop, instrument metrics, test channels |
| **Series A** | Growth team, experiment velocity, paid acquisition |
| **Series B+** | Multiple loops, growth engineering, international expansion |

## Growth Model Framework

```
Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral
    ↑                                               │
    └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For each stage: measure conversion, identify friction, test improvements.

## Human-in-the-Loop

These decisions require human judgment:
- North star metric selection
- Pricing model changes
- Major pivot decisions
- Growth vs profitability tradeoffs
- User experience vs conversion conflicts
- Partnership deal structures
